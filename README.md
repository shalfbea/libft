# libft

Own realisation of some c standart functions

## About

This project is part of program in [School 21](https://21-school.ru/) ([Ecole 42](42.fr)).  
That's my own partial implementation of c std libs functions.  
The main goal of this project is to get deep inside of how
does standart c functions works.

## Requirements

- GNU GCC
- GNU Make

## Installation and usage

1. Download/Clone this repo

   > git clone https://github.com/shalfbea/libft

2. Get into the root directory of project and run make command

   > cd libft
   > make
3. (Optional) Run make bonus to get some additional functionality (lists)

   > make bonus

4. Now you have compiled version of this library - libft.a, which you can use in your projects

## Technical task

The full task can be found here: [libft_subject](https://github.com/shalfbea/libft/blob/main/libft_subject.pdf)

### Quick summary:

- Only using c language is allowed
- Code-style should respect the [The Norm](https://github.com/MagicHatJo/-42-Norm/blob/master/norme.en.pdf)
- No memory leaks, segmentation faults, undefined behavior
- Only allowed functions: malloc, write - but only fow a few functions

### Bonus:

- Added some lists functions
